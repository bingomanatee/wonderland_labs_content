[Elmore Leonard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmore_Leonard), the "Writer's Writer", has passed. His novels were masters of economy and impact. For the textually impaired, his short story inspired television series "Justified" captures in rare form how adults actually talk to each other. 

Here are his ten rules of writing.

1. Never open a book with weather.
2. Avoid prologues.
3. Never use a verb other than "said" to carry dialogue.
4. Never use an adverb to modify the verb "said”…he admonished gravely.
5. Keep your exclamation points under control. You are allowed no more than two or three per 100,000 words of prose. 
6. Never use the words "suddenly" or "all hell broke loose."
7. Use regional dialect, patois, sparingly.
8. Avoid detailed descriptions of characters.
9. Don't go into great detail describing places and things.
10. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.
