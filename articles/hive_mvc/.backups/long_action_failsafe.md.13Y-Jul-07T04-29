There is a timeout for each ?[action script handler](action_scripts) that will pre-emptively return an error if an action takes too long. 

Actions can take too long for any of many reasons: 

1. The action was badly scripted and its handler ended without calling the callback
2. A long task legitimately needs extra time to accomplish its activity, such as writing or searching a long file. 
3. An external process, such as a network or a database, fails badly/loops

If any of these situations occur an error will be sent back to the response.
