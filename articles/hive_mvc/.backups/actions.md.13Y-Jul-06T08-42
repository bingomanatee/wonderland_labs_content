Actions are at the core of Hive. The are a collection of assets designed to respond to one or more URLs. 

This is done (as a rule) through a combination of:

* A **configuration file** that targets one or more urls, grouped by REST Method (GET, POST, ETC.)
* An **?[action script](action_scripts)** that prepares a set of properties for a template
* An **?[EJS Template](template)** that interprets these values into a block of HTML. 

This is different from other MVC applications in which the term "action" refers to the method of a controller file. 

An action is, technically, a folder within ?[Hives](hives_and_frames) "actions" folders.

As much effort has been made to provide the ability to centralize all action-specific files in the actions' folder. 

A typical action folder is structured as follows: 

``` bash

/frames/frame_foo/hives/bar/actions
  vey/
    static
      js
       vey_script.js
    vey_action.js
    vey_view.html
    vey_config.json
```

## Configuration file

The `vey_config.json` file contains the configuration for the action. this includes (but is not limited to) the following properties:

<dl>
<dt>routes</dt>
<dd>an object with one or more of the following properties: 'get','put','post','delete'. The value for these properties are string values, or arrays of strings, in the Express routing pattern: '/foo/bar/vey/:name/:value'. There are no rules (beyond those of the Express parser) for how the routes are structured, other than that they be globally unique. </dd>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Optional if for some reason you want to name the action something other than the name of its containing folder. Action names need not be unique -- they are indexed by the path to their folder. </dd>
<dt>static</dt>
<dd>the mapping of the ?[static files](static_files) in the static folder.
</dl>

#### A typical configuration file:

``` json

{
   "name": "vey",
   "routes": {
      "get": "/vey/:name",
      "post": "/vey/:name"
     },
   "static": {
      "js": "/js/vey",
      "css": "/css/vey"
    }
}

```

note that ALL of this information is optional, except the routes -- you should have at least one route for an action.
