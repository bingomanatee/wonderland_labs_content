In ?[a previous article](passive_aggressive) we setup a basic Hive-MVC site, and hosted it on Heroku. 

Up to now our site is basically a static frame; other than the layout wrapper there's little need to use node (or any backend system) at all because our site is not data driven. 

We will change that here by giving our site a reason to live: to get data on movies by blending fandango and IMDB in interesting and novel ways.
