Car ads tend to imply that your car is essentially your message to the rest of the world. Ignoring the fact that most people either meet you after you have left the parking lot, or meet your car on the road without seeing you in it, lets look at what your car is saying about you. 

#### Hyundai (anything) 

You are either a girl who lives for Cosplay, or a Bronie. 

#### Lexus

Your parents are well to do, but you haven't quite made it, which is why you are driving your mom's Lexus. 

#### Honda Civic

You knocked up your college sweetheart, but she hasn't delivered. Which she will most likely do in the back seat of your Civic

#### Prius

You bang wine country MILFS on the weekend

#### Chevy Malibu

Why you never seem to get past the "Friend Zone" with babes. 

#### Ford Aerostar

What you got after trading in your Civic. 

#### Mustang

You aren't compensating for your tiny penis, you are replacing sexual stimulation with the thrill of running over street hookers. 

#### Volvo

You will, unfortunately, live well into your ninties. 

#### Smart Car

Your primary criteria for a car is, "Can I park it in my studio?"

#### Tesla

You believe in quality, not quantity. Which is good because you have an amazing time driving eight miles, before your battery drains.

#### Ford F-150

Your truck is actually a working truck, if by working you mean transporting the hookers you run over out of state.

#### Honda Fit

You like looking out of a cockpit that looks like an x-wing; its fortunate because if you're driving a slightly enlarged fruit fly you might as well have fun while it lasts.

#### Toyota 4x4

Despite the fact that the cover you had installed over the bed has never been removed, you sincerely think your truck makes you look like a cowboy. 

#### BMW

You have money, a nice house, and a wife, who you haven't spoken to for 17 years.

#### Chevy Tahoe

Killing time before the Rapture, where hopefully, you'll be given a Mustang.
