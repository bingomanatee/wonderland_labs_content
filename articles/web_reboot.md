The top packages list in NPM are interesting in that they are mainly pipes and improvements to basic web processes. things like gulp, grunt, less, coffeeScript, etc., all of which basically are like web/js/os but better. 

At some point we need to be able to greenfield development to actually give people the environment they want instead of re-tooling systems that are just close enough to inspire better ones. 

## From the ashes of Famo.us

I was really sad when Famo.us was unable to manage to shake the web/webgl tree. I think that the fundamental issue they encountered was that they used a tool that has been indifferently put out and lightly used (3d transform DOM) and attempted to use it in a very broad use environment. 

They fell through the same hole that Ruby ends up in quite often -- the assumption that if you develop a layout system that has a small but solid set of good rules that making its performance optimal should be a realistic goal. The problem of course is that machines (and machine subsystems) concept of easily parseable content is not the same as peoples' idea of easily manageable systems. 

In general, the web rendering engines and mobile rendering engines are delivering (and I'm being generous) acceptable performance, and the UI processes and standards are good enough for most cases. However the thing they are best at right now is showing through mixed or negative example what the truly practical system we need is. 

Famo.us is basically the Newton of the multiweb. Or, maybe to be more generous, the MySpace.
