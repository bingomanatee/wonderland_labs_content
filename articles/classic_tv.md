My favorite shows. It is interesting how many of them are police related; it is difficult to come up with modern drama as extreme as the front lines of the class warfare, but there it is. 

## Cancelled Shows

### All in the Family

Never has a show had as much cultural impact build up with blisteringly well acted, flawed characters. Having grown up in the East Coast where it was set, it really captured a place and time in history. 

### Barney Miller

Funny and touching. A departure from "Supercop" shows -- reflects the often tedious and mundane nature of policing and government work. 

### Battlestar Galactica

The retelling of the 70's Sci Fi epic features killer fembots and some of the best writing in any genre in recent memory. The cast features veteran actors and new discoveries who fight tooth and nail for their place in TV history. The epic of two cultures in a death grip spans religion and all the many fissures of humanity. 

### Homicide

A keystone show. Set before you had to ask "*which* 'Law and Order'?" it featured an ensemble cast. It was masterful in generating then destroying sympathy for key characters and eroding clear definitions of right and wrong. It also showed how most police work is reactive, messy, error prone and imperfect. It set the tone for many other keystone shows like *Rescue Me*, *The Shield*, *Justified* and *Sons of Anarchy*, shows that borrowed veteran character actors from *Homicide.* Andre Braugher was introduced on this show, and Richard Belzer's "Det. Munch" actually survived the series into the *Law and Order* franchise.

### The Shield

The most awful cops ever to stain the screen, spearheaded by Michael Chiklis, the dirty, brilliant and corrupt head of a LA urban strike force every bit as evil as the criminals he puts away -- or, in turn, protects and nurtures. Jay Karnes is an amazing counterpoint to Det. Mackie, as a brilliant "White Knight" cop who gets dragged down by Mackie's evil and the wash of despair in the neighborhood, and Walter Goggins' work as Mackie's "Right Hand Man" is frighteningly banal. (He can also be seen in *Justified*, which is ongoing.) Watching Mackie continually dodge individual and institutional retribution for his many dark deeds while dragging down anyone nearby is painfully delightful. 

### Futurama

A complete nerdgasm. 

### Dollhouse

Its hard not to feel like "Part of the problem" in this soft core porn meets Twilight Zone epic by Joss Whedon.

### Sliders

A bit conflicted; after its founder left -- in season three or so -- it kind of went to hell, but the first two seasons are memorable for pure science fiction that dodged easy answers and simple action wrapups. 

### Firefly

Joss Whedon's seminal SF series about a fugitive freighter crews attempt to live outside the reach of the Central Alliance's imperial reach. It really shows the "What should have been" possibilities Lucas gave up in trade for technological fetishism in the Star Wars series.

### Star Trek

The bridge between modern science fiction and the Twilight Zone. 

### The Wire

Is it unfair to list two Baltimore cop shows as cultural touchstones? Tough; because there it is. The Wire lives in the cracks between institutions devoted to law and people nastily pursuing quick scores and petty rivalries. 

### Extras

Ricky Gervais' blistering look at what happens when the smallest of men outgrows his painful limitations as a bit actor and a person to overachieve as a sitcom extra is painful and features an unmatchably adorable parade of walk-ons by self-portraying actors like Patrick Stewart, David Bowie and Daniel Radcliffe violently deconstructing their mythologies. Kate Winslet reciting by rote the cheap tricks you use to get Oscars is hilarious. 

### Breaking Bad

Has absorbed an amazing amount of attention recently -- but making a list of good shows without it would seem a bit bizarre...

### Nip/Tuck

One of the most disturbing shows with unimaginably unflinching portrayal of elective surgery and human depravity. 

### King of the Hill

A remarkably human and deep comedy about shallow people. A must see for students of white culture. 

### Everybody Hates Chris

Chris Rock's recounting of his childhood is a singular departure from African American comedies; it expands rather than merchandises black culture and is a remarkable period piece. Suspended between Sesame Street and All in the Family, it is a masterful piece of storytelling that respects the integrity and weakness of ordinary people living in hard times. 

## Ongoing

### South Park

As awful and gross as it often is, its a great metric for uncommon insights into popular trends. Also, it is one of the most distinctive animated formats around. 

### Doctor Who

The longest running Science Fiction show in history with an immense range of settings and a constantly shifting cast. 

### The Daily Show

The only news on commercial television

### Justified

Elmore Leonard is the most remarkable writer of our time and inspired and worked on this series up to his recent passing. His work shows, in the depth and humanity of his characters. Writing around rural people simultaneously living anachronistic lives while keenly aware that times are changing, often for them, for the worse. 

### Sons of Anarchy

If Ernie road a motorcycle, killed hookers and put his own stepfather in prison, well, I doubt kids would grow up watching Sesame Street, but I sure as hell would. 

### Once upon a Time

I am actually conflicted; while there is a lot going for this series, it does seem a bit held back by the fact that they are super-sensitive that their audience includes young children; despite this, Disney does seem to be pushing the envelope as far as they can, and the writing, within the bounds of the legendary body of work it extends, is sincere and well crafted. 

### Mythbusters

The best of Maker culture deconstructs cultural, scientific and cinema legends with science and experimentation. While the thoroughness of the methods is uneven, the attempt to popularize the scientific method is admirable. Bonus for SF fans as it frequently highlights local landmarks. 

### Top Gear

While I'm not a gearhead, the "Stupid Car Tricks" of Top Gear are a laff and a half. 

### Orphan Black

The X-files like twisted drama of a clone on the run features great ensemble acting and continuous inventiveness.
