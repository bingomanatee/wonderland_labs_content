The Hive MVC project has spawned a series of modules that are useful in their own right. 

* **?[hive component](hive_component)** is the fundamental "building block" core class of most of the rest of hive.
* **?[hive-loader](hive_loader)** reads and digests the content of a series of folders and files based on their naming conventions. 
* ** [hive_config](hive-config)** is a variation of the configuration module, designed to accept input as either a JS
object or a JSON file path with basic get/set property methods.
* **?[hive-menu](hive_menu)** is a utility class for creating nested groups of links in a menu structure. 
* **[hive-queen](https://github.com/bingomanatee/hive-queen)** is an idepodent scaffolding tool for creating hive websites based on a JSON configuration file. 
* **?[hive-model](hive_model)** is a memory model class, suitable for basic unit test/mocking or for resource management. 
* **[hive-model-mongoose](https://github.com/bingomanatee/hive-model-mongoose)** is a hive-model API compliant overlay for mongoose.
