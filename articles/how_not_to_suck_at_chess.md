I've noticed while whaling on (some of) the people on chess.com that there are a lot of mistakes people seem to do over and over again in chess that cost them regularly. I thought I'd make a list of them to give people who may be starting a few things to thing about. 

## In the opening, it is better to move many pieces once than one piece many times.

Many times people get fixated on using a piece like a hero, dashing, prodding and harassing the other player with it (typically the queen, but sometimes knights.) If you don't get pissed and pour everything into capturing it, you can advance a significant number of pieces into the middle ground while chasing it away and at the end of the day your opponent has almost no control over the board while you have several pieces in play. 

## Never lose your queen. 

I know it sounds like a really obvious thing to say but, if you lose your queen, it will take a stroke of brilliance not to lose the game. Not losing your queen means: 

1.  Never put it between your king and another piece, or somewhere that your opponent can pin it with another piece in a single move. 
2. If your opponent has their rooks in play don't put your queen right in front of your king; if they have bishops in play don't put it diagonally between your king and a bishop or a line a bishop can get to. 
3. If they have advancing pawns, don't put it two spaces to either side of the king where a guarded pawn can advance to threaten both pieces.
2. Conversely, when your opponent puts their queen out without support, continue to badger the queen; the queen will nearly always be forced to retreat and you will be able to gain territory and advance pieces. 

## Knights are for forking. 

The single most devastating thing a knight can do is to put the king and another major piece (rook or queen or worse yet, both). The queen's bishop pawn is the perfect target for this; as soon as the queen leaves the back row, it is a natural target for knights. 

## Avoid giving the knight an early bunker of pawns

When a "v" is formed by three of your pawns in a diagonal formation -- or two diagonal pawns and any situation that prevents a pawn from dislodging a knight -- it is a natural shelter for the knight.

From there the knight can attack eight squares in the periphery of the board with impunity. It will take several turns to dislodge the knight; since the knight is the least valuable piece on the board, the best way to do so is to simply trade one of yours for the knight, or move the pawns past the knight to allow easier access to the sheltered knight. Or to occupy that sheltered space before your opponent does.

## Rooks begin the game in a killing box

The rooks almost determine who will win in the end game but they begin in a very vulnerable situation boxed in by the knight and vulnerable to a bishop attack. Gleefully sacrifice your bishops to kill them when that box is left vulnerable.

To ensure that your rooks are not assassinated, move your knights out early to give your rooks at least one square to escape to and castle whenever possible.

If you can insinuate your queen like this, you can often capture several pieces in a row. However, take care to always be able to compute an escape plan for your queen, as there is almost no amount of acquisition you can do in this strategy that justifies her loss. 

## Once you have even a single piece advantage, aggressively trade as often as possible.

If your opponent plays badly and loses a piece in a bad trade or mis-play, press them mercilessly trading as often as possible. Even trading queens is worthwhile if it gains you an extra piece in the process. 

## There are several early ways to get checkmated -- do not give them to your opponent, but seek them out yourself. 

### Fools Mate

### Scholars Mate

The classic "four move mate"

These are the most transparent early mates but are easily blocked by blocking your king's bishop pawn with the knight and not opening your queen's bishop pawn early.

## General "Mindsets"

### Don't over extend yourself

It is rare that early aggression bears fruit unless your opponent is very careless. Its better to counter your opponent and slowly take territory than to go fully aggressive without guarding your pieces. It is better to have no specific plan of attack and bring many pieces out into the middle of the board than to try to cleverly jab at an opponent with heroic strategy and let them take the field from you. 

If you are not playing with a clock, don't let yourself feel pressed to make aggressive moves that put valuable pieces beyond the protection of their peers. Small moves with pairs of protected pieces are better than aggressive sacrifice that costs pieces. Even if you spend several turns simply reacting defensively to your opponents advances, there will come a moment when their momentum has stalled and you will be able to systematically erode their pieces and counterattack against a scattered defense. 

### If you are moved to extend early do it with knights

They are good at dodging around other pieces and hurdling over pawns. If you can put both your knights guarding each other its a very tenacious pair of pieces; they will act as a wedge against aggressive advance and if they are beyond the reach of pawns can only be broken by a knight's trade, or in desperation the sacrifice of a bishop.

### Don't lose morale from an even trade. 

No even trade, even queen-queen, is worth getting upset over. (unless you let yourself get in a piece deficit.) 

Also for the record, trading a knight for a bishop (that is your knight for their bishop) is always a good move. it may seem like a basically even trade but it is not; every move that puts you closer to the endgame diminishes the knight's value and increases the bishop's. (for one thing, only the bishop can assassinate a boxed in rook, which is always a good idea.)

### Feel free to mechanically produce the classic knight and pawn advance

There is rarely any great opportunity for brilliance early in the game. Move your knights and your king and queens pawns out into the field and hope your opponent is devoted to doing something brilliant early on.  

### Once you castle, your King is vulnerable to getting trapped behind a wall of pawns. 

Castling does put one of your rooks into play and its tempting to abandon the king to go hunting pawns with it. But keep an eye towards defense; if either a queen or a rook gets to your backfield while your king is trapped behind three pawns, that is the end of it. So if you are adventuring with your rooks after castling, open at least one of the pawns in front of the king to ensure your opponent can't do a quick trap of your king with a rook or queen.

### Be rigorous about inspecting your ability to defend every piece before moving it. 

Before committing to a move inspect the board to ensure your opponent can't 

1. Take that piece without losing anything (because it is not guarded)
2. Put it in a fork with your king and queen by moving a knight
3. move any one piece to pin it against your king or queen

It may seem tiresome but any variation of this sort of pointless sacrifice will be the beginning of the end. 

### Forcing your opponent repeatedly to do your bidding wears on their morale

Every time you can create a situation where there is only one non-catastrophic move lowers your opponents will and allows you to control the board for two moves (the next move, and whatever move you want to do after that). Doing this repeatedly can crush their spirit. This may seem cruel, but remember, you ultimately want to take their king which will also crush their spirit, and they are quite eager to return the favor, so buck up and start screwing with them. 

After a sequence of forced moves, your opponent will start missing opportunities to be aggressive because they are forced into reflexive defensiveness. As long as you don't get sucked in to the pattern and forget to defend yourself, this can be the beginning of the end for your opponent. 

The easiest way to do this is to put them in check. Even if the check is easily countered, the shock of coming a little closer to the end changes peoples' attitude about the game. 

### Be as eager to take pawns as you are to take pieces

Pawns may be a multitude, but they are also the principal resource by which pieces can be guarded and territory gained. The fewer pawns your opponent has the weaker their ability to defend their king is.
