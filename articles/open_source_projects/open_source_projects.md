Programming has developed on the keyboard -- but really, for the mobile generation, you need to be able to use your 10key keyboard to program. 

Here's a suggestion for some basic syntax. 

````
*0[0-9]4 : a variable name

*1: (
*2: =
*3: )
*4: +
*5: -
*6: *
*7: /
*8: % (mod)
*9: ,

#1 function

````
