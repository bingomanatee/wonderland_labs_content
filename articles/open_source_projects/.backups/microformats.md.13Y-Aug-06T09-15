An interesting tangent happened in the [HTML5 session on microformats); I inquired why you couldn't just document the nature of microformat relevant data with XML and Tatum Celik demonstrated that XML is not as flexible as microformats; because microformats use CSS classes as designators you can overlap several designations on the same piece of information, where an XML tag is a single designation pe node. 

Which really shows yet again what a drag XML is as a content envelope..

In any event ... [Microformats](http://microformats.org/) add yet another layer of meaning on top of HTML content.. They allow parsers to extract data on content like addresses (using the same formats as apple contacts), shopping data, and content to improve your search engine displays.
