There are a few recurring patterns that I've found for managing large scale projects that make them easier to develop and grow. This is focusing on client-heavy UI projects

## 0. Understand the media requirements

The browser is no longer the only media to target and even when it was, there were multiple browsers with a range of limitations all their own.

Now, with mobile and tablets being a major part of the marketplace, responsive concerns are a significant part of the design process and should influence design and process modelling from the start. 

## 1. Create and model clear state changes

Understanding the state of the application and its components is critical to keeping large products under control. This includes modelling the security concerns into the state.

* Which states are enterable without security access (public/anonymous)
* Which level of security must be achieved to enter in specific states
* What the pattern of traversal of states is - linear, random access, hierarchical. 
* How does the creation or modification of data add or change the availability of states
* What events should be triggered when specific states are engaged
* Are there more than one dimensions of state or are all states contained within a unified model

I personally use the Javascript State Machine to model states; it has good eventing, can be merged into existing classes, and easily visualizes the traversal rules. 

## 2. Leverage UI libraries to reduce technical debt 

With the wealth of libraries available, there should be no reason to design a custom widget for mundane elements like dropdowns and buttons. I find Semantic UI to be a great time saver; other engines like Twitter Bootstrap, Cordova and Pure are great timesavers for design and layout. 

Understand the strengths and limitations of your chosen libraries before beginning UI design. Its easier to use customized variations of stock UI tools when the designers understand their UI palette and design with use of your resources in mind from the start. 

## 3. Use structured UI middleware to manage modular development

Being able to organize, reuse and test your code is key to scaling development. There are many modular development engines including

* Angular 
* React
* Ember
* Require
* Meteor

Each of which provides some flavor of modularity; most resemble the CommmonJS model of compartmental code. 

Scaling development by definition includes regression concerns. While developing components, its crucial to understand how, in testing, the components inputs from their behavior. This means

* isolating direct REST polling to external libraries that can be replaced with test input 
* isolating access to system resources (window, document, DOM) from the testable components like state machines and business logic routers
* using MVC patterns to ensure that business logic executes in its own scope

## 3. Designing a useful REST store

Developing a backend layer involves:

* ensuring security around important actions, especially actions that change data
* deciding how request parameters will be passed to the server
* defining a vocabulary of reusable patterns
* deciding when the rest pattern is useful and when you want a richer data set

Building and testing data integrity and security from the start is important for any apps, especially those actions that modify data. Session based security is usable in REST just as it is for the rest of the app. 

Reusing the same patterns of how you want to query the app makes an api more consistent. Part of that is fed to you by the pattern of REST verbs. Make sure you understand the implication of POST vs. PUT and use the rest action that best represents the level of interaction that you want an API to perform. However along with the path, ID and verb of the request, metadata around pagination, searching and parameters like date ranges must often be passed. There are several channels of information for metadata including 

* Headers
* url Query parameters
* body parameters
* url path parameters

Using the transport that requires the least amount of fussing with formatting makes your life easier. For instance, parameters for pagination are numeric -- which are easy to encode in the URL. Search string parameters on the other hand require encoding and are easier to pass as body parameters or headers. 

Ideally, your backend coders won't have to look at too many different parts of the request, so be as consistent as possible with your request parameters. 

### Where's the REST of me?

REST theology requires that each collection of data exists on a different endpoint. This can create a multiplicity of expensive HTTP calls to pull a complete resource from the API. 

While creating an atomic REST system that describes your data in nice little chunks is good, sometimes its better to bring in all the relevant data around major elements. My rule of thumb is:

1. Use request parameters to determine if you want the base or full data suite for a resource. 
2. For the full suite, only bring in one level of sub-resources, and only those resources that aren't expected to be too verbose.
3. Paginate long lists of sub-resources and document the total size of sub-resources available. 
4. Filter our rarely used fields of sub resources to reduce their size

While GETting rich data is good, when it comes to updating data, stay atomic; you should only update one resource at a time, though inserting multiple records in series (of a single type) can work well in some contexts. 

When you do multi-updates, decide up front whether the data is unified; if one record fails should the entire transaction roll back?
