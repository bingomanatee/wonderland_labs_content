There are a few recurring patterns that I've found for managing large scale projects that make them easier to develop and grow. 

1. Create and model clear state changes

Understanding the state of the application and its components is critical to keeping large products under control. This includes modelling the security concerns into the state.

* Which states are enterable without security access (public/anonymous)
* Which level of security must be achieved to enter in specific states
* What the pattern of traversal of states is - linear, random access, hierarchical. 
* How does the creation or modification of data add or change the availability of states
