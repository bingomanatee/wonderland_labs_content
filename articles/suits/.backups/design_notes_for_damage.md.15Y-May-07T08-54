I've been wrestling with damage/hit point systems (mainly in my head) and I think part of the problem is my decisin making process is spinning in circles because my thoughts are not written down. so:

## Problems with the basic hit point system. 

I have two problems with the "Dead or Alive" hit point system that is prevalent in both RPG and video games. 

* It doesn't reflect reality
* It doesn't reflect movie/comic book reality
* It doesn't alter player behavior based on assessed risk

When your hit point trough going from 1 to zero is just as fatal when it is done with a tossed beer mug as with a refrigerator falling on you, then the scale of your opponent is less, or more, of a consideration in many cases. 

Plus, it makes boxing matches and barroom brawls as potentially fatal as gunfights. 

Lastly, not every weapon has the same proportionality of lethality. A baseball bat, for instance, has the same kinetic impact as a small caliber bullet, but the bullets narrow focus converts more of its kinetic energy to lethal penetration. The same effect is true to some extent for arrows, spears and swords. 

## Goals of the SUITS system

The basic thrust is this:

* Have a system which records kinetic/short term damage -- **stun** -- and injury "deep" **damage** separately
* Have larger attacks do more damage, either by 
  * having larger attacks do more damage 
  * "capping" stun damage and converting large amounts of kinetic impact to damage 
  * having a max stun capacity for accumulated stun past which all kinetic damage converts to damage
* Have weapon types have a greater ratio of damage to stun based on penetration rating

The three fundamental effects that are desired are this:

1. gradual weak attacks wear down targets but cause them to pass out; hopefully becoming less effective in the process
2. single large attacks cause lethal damage causing targets to pass out and begin dying. 
3. high penetration weapons cause more lethal damage compared to similar kinetic attacks than blunt weapons

## Inputs

there are several inputs to the calculation of the effect of an individual blow:

### Weapon Strength

The weapon strength for a hand weapon is based on the leverage of a weapon (that multiplies the user strength) and a fixed bonus based on the weapon's head; 

### Penetration

Penetration is a concept from GURPS. It reflects the fact that focused kinetic damage (blades and spears) are much more damaging to flesh then they are to armor. For instance a spear does very little damage to a door in comparison to a sword, relative to their effects on human flesh. 

Weapon penetrations ranges:

* -2 (boxing gloves, padded weapons, wrestling)
* -1 (fists, small animal attacks, wooden weapons)
* 0  (metal clubs, shotgun pellets)
* 1  (swords and axes, knives, bullets)
* 2  (spears and arrows)

Note -- guns have relatively small penetration because they also have very high kinetic energy making them effectively armor piercing through brute force. (some bullets are also AP in that they reduce the effectiveness of armor through design and material choice.)

Penetration does one of two things: 

1. changes the ratio of stun to actual damage
2. adds to all damage taken after armor
3. some combination of the above

#### Leverage 

Leverage is a multiplier between 50% and 150%. as a rule, leverage is:

* 50% for hand weapons/unarmed fighting (knives)
* 75% for short one-handed weapons 1'/300cm (shortswords) and thrust weapons (spears)
* 100% for medium one-handed weapons  2'/600cm (swords)
* 125% for large two-handed weapons 3'/1m (war axes/mauls)

#### Damage Bonus

There is a significant difference between a baseball bat and a sword; this is reflected in a damage bonus/modifier based on weapon weight and material (smaller area of impact == greater damage)

* -1 for unarmed fighting
* 0 for wooden clubs, spears and staves
* +1 for swords, light axes and metal clubs
* +2 for warhammers and heavy axes/poleaxes

As a note, heavier weapons that do more damage often have windup/cooldown periods in which they cannot attack, so they do more damage but attack less often.

#### Net Effect

The range of damage from leverage is

* 2 - 4 for unarmed combat or knife fights
* 5 - 7 for swordfights
* 6 - 10 for one handed weapons (Axes and mauls)
* 7 - 12 for two handed heavy weapons (war axes and maces)

*revision note*: the offensive damage is significantly underpowered for the range of armor. may boost leverage significantly. Alternately, do not include target in defensive ranking, just use it to scale damage effect.

### Armor Defense

Armor has three defensive traits: 

1. rigid armor **absorbs** some kinetic input completely
2. soft armor **disperses** some kinetic damage around the focus of impact, reducing the focused effect of bladed and piercing weapons to penetrate deeply into the body by spreading the force across a larger area. this effectively cancels out penetration
3. thick armor reflects some attacks completely, increasing your defensive capacity 

Your basic defense is your body + armor's dispersion

* 4 - 6 for unarmored fighters with normal strength(Body 4-5)
* 6 - 9 for lightly armored fighters (Body 4-5, armor 2-4)
* 10- 12 for heavily armored professional fighters (body 5-6, armor 4-6)

## Determining effect from power and toughness

The interaction of offensive power (weapon kinetic energy), penetration and toughness (defensive armor and body) 

### Option A: the GURPS model

this model is common amongst a lot of RPGs. 

1. Damage is random in the range of 1..weapon power
2. Armor is fixed and subtracts from the resulting kinetic energy
3. Penetration multiplies by the effective damage
4. the effect of the net damage is scaled by the defenders' Body

Dispersion being new to this equation opens the question - should it precede or follow penetration scaling? I'm thinking follow (3.1) at this point. 

### Option B: a contest model

My problems with this model is that armor is rarely so consistent as to be fairly represented as a constant; my thinking is that armor should range from 0..Dispersion. 
Also both damage and dispersion should be relatively constant

### Option C: Hybrid contest 

This option uses the action/contest to determine the power of the attack/defense on this theory: 

Your attack skill has a range of 1.. N; that is if your rank in a weapon skill is 7, you can use a card from A(1) to 7 for your attack. The higher the attack is, the lower your power will be. 

The simplest tradeoff is Power = Max Power * (Max Skill - Card + 1)/(Max Skill + 1). 

The catch is, the higher your card is, the higher the chance of getting a successful hit. 

Say you have a power of 10 and a skill of 7. You have two possible cards to play for your attack: a 4 and a 6. 

If you play a 4 (and your target doesn't defend successfully) your power will be 10 * (7 - 4 + 1)/(7 + 1) = 10 * 4/8 = 5. 

Alternately if you play a 2, ( " " ) your power will be 10 * (7 - 2 + 1)/7 + 1) = 10 * 6/8 = 7.5, rounded to 8. 

This means, for instance, that even people with skills so high that they can never draw a card within the top of their skill range get a payoff from their huge skill rank.
