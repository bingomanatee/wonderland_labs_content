Your state stack reflects your current energy, readiness and attitude, and accrued damage. It is a stack or series of cards in this order:

* defense (face down) cards or white poker chips
* initiative (face up) cards or a red poker chip
* action (face down) cards or white poker chips

Its recommended that damage be tracked with poker chips especially if you have a limited deck (less than three combined decks). 

Everyone starts with four face down cards, then flips over one of them to break their hand into three stacks.

Initiative face cards are generally low (J = 1, Q = 2, K = 3) unless the player is super fast in which case they can be taken as high (J = 11, Q = 2, K = 3). 

## Viewing and revealing your stack

You must always reveal when asked how many action and defense cards you have, and the value of your initiative card. You can always look at both your action and defense stacks but you cannot redistribute cards between the stacks without taking a turn to replenish your stacks. 

## Setting initiative

In the beginning of each round, if you do not have a flipped up initiative card, you flip over one or more of your face down cards and keep the highest card that is not greater than your Speed. If both your cards are above your Speed retain one of the cards as a windup card (see below). Note that you must include your encumbrance penalty in this case to determine your maximum valid initiative card before a windup penalty is taken. 

In some circumstances, such as when some members are taken by surprise, one or more delay cards are added face up in front of your attack stack to remind you that you have to spend some turns winding up before you can act. 

## Order of action

Players act in phases; phases are based on the number of action cards you have -- those with the most action cards act in the first phase, then the next highest, etc. 

Within each phase players act in descending order of their initiative cards.

Those with no action cards (but who do have an initiative card) act in descending order of initiative; they can move or reorder their stack, but cannot act offensively. 

Lastly those without an initiative card act; they can set their initiative (in descending order of Speed attribute) and can only set their initiative.  
 
## Actions

On your turn you can do one of the following: 

### Act

If on your turn you have any action cards, you can take any active action you want. Choose a skill to use and determine your rank at that skill. You can take one or more cards from your action stack and to those cards, add a single card drawn from the deck. 

Play the card of your choice as the action and discard the other cards in your hand. If this is a contest, place it face down and let the defender choose their defense card.

#### Contests 

If your action is offensive against another character you perform a **contest of skill**. After you declare how many action cards you're drawing from your pool, the defender draws zero or more cards from their defense pool and adds a card from the deck.  

Both the defender and the attacker can pre-commit one or more of their boost cards in both phases of the contest. They then each draw a card from the deck and choose the single card that is lower than or equal to their rank; Aces are 1, Face cards (J, Q, K) are 11, 12, 13, or 1, 2, 3, drawers' choice. 

If the attacker wins, or ties the defender and has more attack cards in play, they succeed. 

##### Windup and Cooldown

Some weapons have to be wound up (prepared before use) or cooled down (prepared after use). 

Before a weapon that has to be wound up is used, put a second face up card in front of your action stack to remind you that your weapon is not wound up. In order to prepare that weapon, you must spend an action winding up the weapon (after which the reminder card is discarded. 

Similarly, after a weapon with cooldown is used, put a second face up card in front of your action stack. 

Some weapons require multiple cooldowns and windups, and therefore, multiple reminder cards. For instance a bow has at least two windup cards -- one to draw an arrow, one to draw the bow. 

The value of the reminder card is irrelevant -- its just a placeholder. 

### Replenishing your stacks

Instead of acting you can draw new cards from the stack. 

Draw a card to determine how many cards you get. if you draw...

* up to or below the sum of all the cards in your current stack (including defense, offense and initiative card) add one card
* above the sum of your cards, add two cards. 
* above twice the sum of your cards, add three cards. 

If you replenish your stack you can neither move nor act nor discard a windup card that turn.

You can distribute your cards between your action and defense stacks as you wish, and can even move cards freely from one stack to another as your replenish your stack.
