Armor has two important stats; defense, which increases your chance to avoid damage due to a glancing blow, and damage absorption that reduces the kinetic value of damage. These values are for hand to hand/weapon attacks; reduce damage absorption is halved vs modern gunfire.

Other common material modifiers: 

* Stone weapons: mail is +1 vs. stone weapons; plate is +2. 
* Bronze: Steel plate and mail is +1 vs. bronze weapons; bronze plate is -1 vs. steel weapons

Armor has three benefits: 

* Hard armor **Absorbs** damage well completely insulating a portion of incoming damage
* Soft armor **Disperses** damage -- you still feel the kinetic energy but it converts focused killing kinetic energy to dispersed stunning energy.
* Thick armor **Deflects** attacks causing glancing blows to be more likely to be redirected and not effect the target; this is a defensive bonus to the users attempt to dodge/block incoming attacks. 

### Notes

* Leather and fur is common wear for pre-bronze age cultures. 
  * **Boiled Leather** is thick, hard and tough.
  * **Studded leather** is reinforced with bone and/or metal studs and rings. The studs are not heavy or frequent enough to qualify as lacquered or mail, but enough to deflect some glancing blows. 
* **Mail** is a flexible metal shirt of tiny metal rings, worn over medium leather and padding. 
* **Lacquered Armor** is made of hard material -- wood, bone, even lacquered paper. Common in Asia for light troops. 
* **Plate** is classic dark ages armor of the elite class of European soldiers.
