Due to the finality of combat, there are specific rules for dealing with it that override the basic contest rules. 

Mortal combat has more specific rules regarding initiative.

## Stamina

Each character in combat gets a deck of three cards that represent their current stamina. These cards may be played at any point instead of drawing a card. At no point can your stamina exceed three cards; when it does you may choose a card to discard from your hand. 

## Rounds

On the first round (or, the first round a character enters combat) you can place a card from your hand face down as your initiative marker. When all cards are placed, flip over the cards over. 

If the card is below your movement rate, turn it sideways, to indicate you will act in the second phase.

Characters act in descending order of their cards; then, those with sideways cards act in descending order. 

In the event of a tie, act in order of suit: **heart**, **diamond**, **club**, **spade**. 

Rounds represent about two seconds of real world time.

### Actions

In your turn you can do one of the following tasks:

* **Attack**: choose an enemy character to target and attack
* **Revive**: attempt to replenish your Will pool with a successful contest of your Will v. all accumulated damage
* **Assist**: give one of your cards to an adjacent ally
* **Windup/Ready**: prepare a weapon for use (See weapons tables for details)
* **Move**: travel your full move. 
* **Buff**: put a card aside to buff your next action
* **Misc**: any other activity. 

### Attacking: 

Attacking a character is a contest of your offensive Speed versus your targets' defensive speed. 

### State and Damage:

Everyone in combat has a state; the possible states are:

<table cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><th>State</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td>Fresh</td><td>Act normally</td>
<tr><td>Wounded</td><td>All Skills are at 50% (min -1)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Crippled</td><td>All Movement, Attributes (including manual weapon Strength) are at 50% (min -1)*; Will check every round or pass out</td><tr>
<tr><td>Mortal</td><td>Automatically pass out; Body check every two rounds or die</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dead</td><td>Do not pass "Go".</td></tr>
</table>

&ast; does not affect toughness

Once you are hit, you engage in a contest of Strength vs. the targets' Toughness. The margin of victory determines whether the target descends to a lower state. 

#### Strength 

The net weapons' power; either fixed (as for a gun) or computed from Body. 

#### Toughness

Your net damage resistance; generally speaking your Body + Armor. 

#### Margin of Victory

The margin of victory is a product of the contest of Strength v/ Toughness; however if you draw over your Strength(or toughness) your value in the contest is half your score (round up). 

The effect depends on the margin of victory and the defenders' Body.
