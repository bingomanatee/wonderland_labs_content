Suits characters can be initialized using one of two methods:

## Purchasing Abilities

Abilities can be purchased using People Points (PP). A typical character starts with 30 PP.

### Attributes

The cost for Attributes (in PP) are as follows: 

<table border=1 cellpadding=4><tr><th>Attribute
<th>1<th>2<th>3<th>4<th>5<th>6*
<tr><td>PP Cost
<td>-10<td>-4<td>0<td>6<td>14<td>25</table>

Note that unlike skills attributes are difficult to improve over time; if for instance you were born with a Body of rank 4 and wanted to improve it to rank 5, it would cost 16 PP, not the 8 that is the gap between 4 and 5 on this table. Choose wisely! 

&ast; Only one of your attributes may be set to level 6.

### Skills

Skills are bought initially at the same rank as a base attribute (or half that for hard skills). Add one to your rank for that skill if you have studied a college that contains the skill. (this does *not* compound -- there is no bonus for learning a skill that is in more than one college you have studied.)

Your maximum skill rank at any given skill is twice the base attribute; so if your base attribute is three for a given skill, your maximum rank in the attribute is six. 

<table border=1 cellpadding=4>
<tr>
<th>
<th>Base
<th>+1
<th>+2
<th>+3
<th>+4
<th>+5
<tr>
<td>PP cost
<td>1
<td>2
<td>4
<td>8
<td>12
</table>

### Colleges

Colleges cost 3 points (except as noted). This gives you all skills in the college at base level (or half base attributes, for hard skills). Any further improvement must be bought on a skill by skill basis; You cannot purchase a college multiple times.

You can learn at most one college for every two points of Mind your character has

# Drawing Character Cards

Alternately you can draw a characters' ability off this table. Keep drawing cards until your characters' cost is 30 PP or higher.  (or draw ten cards, though results may vary)

<table cellpadding=4 border=1>
<tr>
<th>Value<th>Diamond<th>Heart<th>Spade<th>Club<tr>
<td>K, Q, J<td>+1 Mind<td>+1 Will<td>+1 Speed<td>+1 Body<td>Worth two cards<tr>
<th>J, 10, 9<td>Academic College<td>Social College<td>Outdoor College<td>Fighting college<tr>
<th>8, 7, 6<td>Craft College<td>Tech/Magic College<td>Travel College<td>Medical College<tr>
<th>5, 4, 3<td>Creative College<td>Priest College<td>Athletic College<td>Trade College<tr>
<th>A, 2<td>Covert College<td>Covert College<td>Fighting College<td>Outdoor College</table>

## Attributes
If you draw a face card it is worth two cards to bring an attribute to 4 (+1), three to bring an attribute to 5(+2) and four to bring an attribute to 6(+3). You must redraw any further face cards of that suit as, mentioned above, no character can have more than one attribute at 6. 

If at the end of the process the attributes are not reflective of the Characters' skill base, you can swap one set of face cards for another; that is, if your character has abundant medical (mostly Mind) skills and a high(+3) Speed and only one Mind(diamond) face card (for +1), you can take the +3 to your Mind instead of to your Speed, and the +1 to your Speed instead of your mind.

## Colleges/Skills

As noted above, the maximum colleges you can get is half your Mind (round down). When you have your maximum colleges, you *must* take individual skills -- either two at base skill or one at +1. until then you *may* opt to either take the college, or specialize in a single college skill. 

If you take a college with one card and redraw the same college, you can take two skills from the college at +1 or one at +2.
