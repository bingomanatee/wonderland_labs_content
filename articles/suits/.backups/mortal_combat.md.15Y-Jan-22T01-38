Due to the finality of combat, there are specific rules for dealing with it that override the basic contest rules. 

Mortal combat has more specific rules regarding initiative.

## Stamina

Each character in combat gets a deck of three cards that represent their current stamina. These cards may be played at any point instead of drawing a card. At no point can your stamina exceed three cards; when it does you may choose a card to discard from your hand. 

## Rounds

On the first round (or, the first round a character enters combat) you can place a card from your hand face down as your initiative marker. When all cards are placed, flip over the cards over. 

If the card is below your movement rate, turn it sideways, to indicate you will act in the second phase.

Characters act in descending order of their cards; then, those with sideways cards act in descending order. 

In the event of a tie, act in order of suit: **heart**, **diamond**, **club**, **spade**. 

Rounds represent about two seconds of real world time.

### Actions

In your turn you can do one of the following tasks:

* **Attack**: choose an enemy character to target and attack
* **Revive**: attempt to replenish your Will pool with a successful contest of your Will v. all accumulated damage
* **Assist**: give one of your cards to an adjacent ally
* **Windup/Ready**: prepare a weapon for use (See weapons tables for details)
* **Move**: travel your full move. 
* **Buff**: put a card aside to buff your next action
* **Misc**: any other activity. 

### Attacking: 

Attacking a character is a contest of your offensive Speed versus your targets' defensive speed. 

#### Damage

If you win, your margin of success (min 1) scaled by the power ratio of your weapons' Power over your targets' defensive power (Body + Armor). round up at 0.5+. 

For example: if you hit your target by drawing a 5, and your skill is 8, the margin of success is 3. If your Power with that weapon is 7 and their body is 4; you will do 3 * (7/4) = 5.25, rounded to 5, points of damage to your target.

Draw one card for every point of damage you do. If you do more than four points of damage, the fourth card affects multiple points of damage. 

* Every red card reduces your targets' Body pool by one. (Injury)
* Every black card reduces your targets' Will pool by one. (Shock)

**Optional: Penetration**

Penetration reflects the fact that some weapons are better at producing internal damage than others. The difference between your weapons' penetration and the targets' anti-penetration value, in combination with the suit and value of the card, determines whether each card produces injury or shock. 

As detailed in the table below, face cards (and aces) always determine the nature of the injury based on their color. Cards 2-9's effect varies with net penetration
