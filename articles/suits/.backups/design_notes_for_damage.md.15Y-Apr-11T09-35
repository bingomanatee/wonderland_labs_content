I've been wrestling with damage/hit point systems (mainly in my head) and I think part of the problem is my decisin making process is spinning in circles because my thoughts are not written down. so:

## Problems with the basic hit point system. 

I have two problems with the "Dead or Alive" hit point system that is prevalent in both RPG and video games. 

* It doesn't reflect reality
* It doesn't reflect movie/comic book reality
* It doesn't alter player behavior based on assessed risk

When your hit point trough going from 1 to zero is just as fatal when it is done with a tossed beer mug as with a refrigerator falling on you, then the scale of your opponent is less, or more, of a consideration in many cases. 

Plus, it makes boxing matches and barroom brawls as potentially fatal as gunfights. 

Lastly, not every weapon has the same proportionality of lethality. A baseball bat, for instance, has the same kinetic impact as a small caliber bullet, but the bullets narrow focus converts more of its kinetic energy to lethal penetration. The same effect is true to some extent for arrows, spears and swords. 

## Goals of the SUITS system

The basic thrust is this:

* Have a system which records kinetic/short term damage -- **stun** -- and injury "deep" **damage** separately
* Have larger attacks do more damage, either by 
  * having larger attacks do more damage 
  * "capping" stun damage and converting large amounts of kinetic impact to damage 
  * having a max stun capacity for accumulated stun past which all kinetic damage converts to damage
* Have weapon types have a greater ratio of damage to stun based on penetration rating

The three fundamental effects that are desired are this:

1. gradual weak attacks wear down targets but cause them to pass out; hopefully becoming less effective in the process
2. single large attacks cause lethal damage causing targets to pass out and begin dying. 
3. high penetration weapons cause more lethal damage compared to similar kinetic attacks than blunt weapons

## Inputs

there are several inputs to the calculation of the effect of an individual blow:

### Weapon Strength

The weapon strength for a hand weapon is based on the leverage of a weapon (that multiplies the user strength) and a fixed bonus based on the weapon's head; 

#### Leverage 

Leverage is a multiplier between 50% and 150%. as a rule, leverage is:

* 50% for hand weapons/unarmed fighting (knives)
* 75% for short one-handed weapons 1'/300cm (shortswords) and thrust weapons (spears)
* 100% for medium one-handed weapons  2'/600cm (swords)
* 125% for large two-handed weapons 3'/1m (war axes/mauls)

#### Damage Bonus

There is a significant difference between a baseball bat and a sword; this is reflected in a damage bonus/modifier based on weapon weight and focus (smaller area of impact == greater damage)

* -1 for unarmed fighting
* 0 for wooden clubs and staves
* +1 for swords
* +2 for warhammers and spears

As a note, heavier weapons that do more damage often have windup/cooldown periods in which they cannot attack, so they do more damage but attack less often.

#### Net Effect

The range of damage from leverage is

* 2 - 4 for unarmed combat or knife fights
* 5 - 7 for swordfights
* 6 - 10 for one handed weapons (Axes and mauls)
* 7 - 12 for two handed heavy weapons (war axes and maces)

### Defensive Strength

Your basic defense is your body + your [Armor's Defensive Strength](/blog/suits/armor). This equates to 

* 4 - 6 for unarmored fighters with normal strength(Body 4-5)
* 6 - 9 for lightly armored fighters (Body 4-5, armor 2-4)
* 9 - 14 for heavily armored professional fighters (body 5-6, armor 6-8)

## Contests of Strength

The contest of strength involves both parties drawing a card and attempting to draw a value under or equal to your strength.
