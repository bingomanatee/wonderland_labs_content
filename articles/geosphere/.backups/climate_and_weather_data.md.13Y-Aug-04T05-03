A host of global data have been added to the GeoSphere project. 

Note, most of the Climate classes take one of two arguments: 

1. a number, by which they create their own Planet with the given resolution
2. a planet, which they add data to. 

By this method, you can have many planets with different resolutions for your climate data, or one shared planet with all the data embedded in it. 

As a reminder, [Planets](planets) store data on given vertexes in a separate registry. You can extract a vertex data from the planet directly or by iterating over its vertices:

``` javascript

        var albedo = new Albedo(5);

        albedo.load(function () {
            console.log('vertex 1 albedo: %s', albedo.planet.vertex_data(1, 'albedo')) // 0.100
            albedo.planet.vertices(function(vertex){ console.log('vertex %s albedo', 
               vertex.index, vertex.data('albedo')); 
               });
          });
```

## Albedo data

Albedo is the measure of how much of the solar energy is reflected by the earths' surface. Surface albedo data is extracted from [NASA data](http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NASA/.ERBE/.ALL/.clear-sky/.albedo/datafiles.html) and is stored in the planet's "albedo" data channel. The albedo data is a number 1.100.

``` javascript

        var albedo = new Albedo(5);

        albedo.load(function(){ console.log('albedo loaded');});
```

## Biome

(being upgraded)

## Elevation

Based on  [NOAA Data](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/report/), the `GLOBE_Data_Reader` class returns the height of a point based on a set of binary data tiles by reading a speck or row of memory of the tiles. The data returned is height above sea level in meters. 

Note that the GLOBE_data does not have a planet property, unlike the climate modules. 

It can populate a planet with data from its tiles:

``` javascript

        var planet = new Planet(4);
        var index = new GLOBE_data_reader.Index(GLOBE_DATA);
        index.init(function () {
            index.set_planet_elevation(planet, 'height', function () {
                console.log('planet data set');
             });
       });
```

Because the data is kept on file, all the polling methods are asynchronous: 

``` javascript
    index.u_v_height(0.5, 0.5, function(err, height){
      console.log('height at 0.5, 0.5 == %s', height);
});
```
