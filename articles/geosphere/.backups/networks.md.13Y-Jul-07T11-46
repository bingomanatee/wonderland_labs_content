A network of points is a collection of ?[Vertices](vertices) that represent a specific resolution. The vertices are decorated into nodes which have connections to neighboring nodes, and other use-specific data. 

To generate networks from planets, execute the following code: 

#### generating networks

``` javascript

planet = new Planet();
planet.init_iso(2);
var network_0 = new Network(planet, 0);
var network_1 = new Network(planet, 1);
var network_2 = new Network(planet, 2);

```
