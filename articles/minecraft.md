Minecraft is a deep game; and while you can't really "Lose", you can kill a lot of time getting and losing resources. 

Here are some observations to keep your pogress upwards and frustratios to a minimum.

## The first night

Surviving the first night is tough; you have no armor, no resources, and don't know the area.

### Keep your eye out for a good first camp

As you follow the steps below, keep an eye out for a good place to build your first shelter.

#### High and Safe

A high cliff with a narrow peninsula is ideal; you only have to wall off the peninsula. 

#### Island Life

An island just big enough to build a cabin -- say, around 5 x 5 squares -- is ideal. If you have to fight monsters, its best to be on ground when the monsters are treading water. 

## Gather resources

Be quick about it! Keep an eye on the sun. Once it starts going down -- when it is 3-4 sun-lengths from the horizon -- drop everything and build a shelter. 

1. The first thing you need is wood. claw your way at trees until you have four blocks of wood. 
2. Render all that wood into planks.
3. Build a crafting table with a 2 x 2 block of planks
4. build an axe and a sword. 
5. Save three planks; use the rest to make wood poles for future tools

Your next steps depend on local resources. 

### Take advantage of local resources

#### If you can find sheep
Kill sheep until you have at least three wool blocks. They can be of any/different colors. 

#### If you can find coal
Coal are stone blocks with mottled black spots. 
Mine at least four blocks of coal. 

#### If you can find cows, chickens or pigs
Kill them with swords and mine at least eight blocks of stone to build an oven to cook them in.

## First night building priorities

The first thing you need to build is a shelter. If your shelter is not in a esaily defensible position you might just want to build a minimal (3 x 3) tower with an open top so you can see when the sun is up again. It only has to be 4 blocks high or so -- if you are in this mini-well the monsters can't see you and therefore can't kill you. 

At this point when night falls, dig down and make a bigger cellar, with say, 5 x 3 tiles and 2-3 blocks high. (You can dig that space out with your bare hands if you are on dirt or gravel. 

* If you have coal, make torches and light up your space. 
* If you have wool, make a bed and sleep out the night. 
* If you have meat and stone, make an oven and cook the meat. 

## Fighting the Monsters

Monsters, or MOBs in "Minecraft Speak", are a pain. They are, fortunately, fairly stupid and predictable. They are not, however, slow, and they can cause a lot of damage, especially in groups. 

Here's some tips to fight them off. 

0. **Stay Full**. If you are well fed, you will heal any wounds you take, surprisingly fast. If you have any "Humger Pips" you will stay wounded and die much faster. 
1. **Protect your flanks**. If you can put yourself against cliffs or next to water (or both) you can prevent MOBs from sneaking up behind you or surrounding yourself from all sides. Monsters are especially easy to kill when they are bobbing in the water. 
2. **Keep the lights on**. You need torches to keep the monsters visible. Torches can be accidentally taken out by swinging your sword at them so have at least two torches near by at places you won't be swinging your sword at. (torches in pumpkins, jack-o-lanterns -- are ideal; they can't be taken out with a single sword strike or two and they are brighter than torches. Moreover, MOBS (hostile ones) only spawn in darkness; so if you can illuminate huge areas of the neighborhood, you'll be relatively MOB free. Take special care to light nooks and crannies which can be especially dark -- and therefore, spawn large numbers of MOBs. 
3. **Armor Up**. While building armor from iron is ideal it takes time; if you can build up (and slaughter) a large number of cows, you can build armor from their hides as well. **Its not advisable to go too deeply into mines unless you have at least some plate armor**
4. **Ranged Combat**. It takes a while to build up a bow and a sizeable number of arrows. (how to: farm chickens and re-mine vertical stacks of gravel for arrowheads.) To build up a hefty quiver you need two things: 1) a chicken farm to generate feathers and 2) a fair supply of gravel to mine down for flint. You can do this by repeatedly jump-building a tower of gravel then shovel mining gravel for flint. You can re-build and re-mine the same stack of gravel as many times as you want, but you need to build a very tall (60+) stack of gravel often because only 1 in 10 gravel blocks will drop flint. 
5. **Creepers are the worst.** Even if you win a fight with a creeper they can make you feel like you lost by turning your home into a smoking crater. Its better to run away from creepers than risk your built-up areas in a creeper fight. The best way to fight creepers is with a bow and arrow. Also, if you fight them in water, even if they explode, the water will absorb the blast. 

## Building up a homestead

You need three things in a proper homestead. 

1. Continuing food source
2. Protection from MOBs
3. A secure bedroom

### Making a farm

The easiest way to generate food is to cultivate wheat. Wheat grows fastest when planted near water; build multiple strips of 5 x N cultivated land next to water and plant wheat crops there. 

1. Build a hoe
2. Use it on your dirt strips
3. beat on grass (with your bare hands) until you have 16 or so seeds
4. plant the seeds on your dirt strips
5. wait til the grass turns golden brown
6. beat the fully grown wheat with your bare hands and collect the seeds and wheat from it. 
7. re-plant and expand your wheat fields.
8. build bread from the wheat

This process takes a while; you'll want to kill and cook a few cows and pigs while your crops grow. 

#### Ranching

Ranching can be a fast way to generate self-spawning sources of food. Prepare your meat-pens for large populations of animals. Make them at lest 20 x 20. You may want to dig a trench around the inside border of the animal pen, 3 blocks wide and one deep; the animals will congreate there, and you can jump out into the dirt island inside it and not get caught up in the herd. 

Animals will try and leave with you so build an "Airlock" with a secondary gate. 

Also, keep an eye out for creepers in the herd. If they show up, just go far away and they'll disappear on their own. 

You don't have to build a tall fence to keep them in. One row of wood gates will keep animals in. You can also build dirt up on the outside of the gate. Animals may go over the top of the dirt and fense and fall into your pen, and be trapped there with the rest of the herd. 

You can climb up this dirt outside the fence to feed the animals inside the pen without having to get in with the animals yourself. 

#### Some are more equal than others

Not all animals are of equal worth for ranching. 

* **Chickens** are great multi-purpose animals. Once you have made a bow from spiderweb and wood they are essential for renewing your supply of arrows, and they can be eaten. 
* **Cows** have the most food value per unit of food. Their hide can be made into (crappy) armor.
* **Pigs** can only be farmed if you have **carrots** which are pretty rare; if you don't have carrots, don't farm pigs. 
* **Horses** can only be used if you have a saddle which currently you must find. 
* **Dogs** are nominally useful; they will fight enemies for you but easily hurt themselves by falling etc.
* **Cats** are useful for scaring away creepers. 
* **Sheep** are useful for making beds -- but oddly enough cannot be eaten.

### Build up a secure home

Building up a secure home is more than just building four walls and putting a door on one. You'll want to consider a few other defensive techniques:

* **Build it up tall**. Even if you are technically walled off from monsters, if they are close enough, they can prevent you from sleeping. This is not dangerous, but is a pain in the ass. The best way to prevent monsters from being that close is to build a very tall tower and build a house on top of that. A fast (if not especially attractive) way to do that is to build a tower out of a single stack of dirt or stone, then build a platform on top of that. (do this near water so if you fall you can land safely in water.) Put a ladder on the tower for easy access. (MOBs can't use ladders. One of the worst situations you can end up with is to be in a house in which "You cannot sleap: there are monsters nearby". A tall house means there are no monsters nearby.  

* **Light it up**. A cabin that spawns MOBs is not a safe cabin. 

* **Add Windows**. Make glass by cooking sand so you can see what you're walking out into in the morning. Many (but not all) MOBS may be on fire, but some might lurk under trees; skeleton archers sniping from trees are not a healthy breakfast. 

* **Clear the surrounding terrain**. Remove nearby trees and flatten out terrain, and add torches to minimize nearby MOBS (or see them coming) 

* **Make your homestead easy to see from a distance**. A tall tower with plenty of torches can help you find home no matter how far you roam.

* **DO NOT create large unlit rooms**. These will become monster factories. Unless that is what you actually want, light up all rooms. (for instance, I made a giant parymid that was very noisy at night ... and during the day ... 

* **build moats**. Building your home on the shore and/or surrounding it with water means that even if you end up with monsters around your house they will be very slow and ineffective. Better still, lava trenches, wood/stone fences. 

## Exploration

Explore your nearby areas for resources and villages. If you can find a nearby village, take advantage of it; bring your bed over and move in. Its got a lot of things you'd otherwise have to build yourself. 

Build roads as you go to make sure you can easily find your way home. one block wide/deep trenches with torches on their sides are ideal. Build them very straight and always put the torches on the right so you can know how to go home (by going down the trench with torches on your left.) 

Find nearby herds of animals and lure them into pens (that you build near your home) to provide provisions for longer expeditions. (Cow meat is the best source of protein.)

As you explore, make maps out of paper (papyrus), iron and redstone (compasses). They make it easy to navigate large swaths of distant terrain and will give you a way to find out which direction you are pointing in. 

Note that even if you are off the map, if you are near one of its edges, you can determine your relative position based on the location of your "pip" on that border. 

## Mining 

The best place to mine is to exploit a deep canyon. Canyons expose a huge amount of rock making it very easy to get a large number of precious materials (coal, iron) with a minimum of exploration. 

Build a diagonal staircase to get down to the floor of a canyon. 

Once you have mined a surplus of iron (and have a good suit of armor) use iron to make a sword and a pickaxe out of iron. The sword kills monsters faster; the pickaxe mines faster and is the only way to mine diamonds. 

Light up the cave as you go. Lit areas will not spawn monsters. 

## The netherworld

Once you find diamonds, build yourself a gate to the netherworld. Its bricks are useful for two purposes: 

1. You can build netherbrick, which is blast resistant, for a creeper-proof home. 
2. You can put it around your home and light it up for a burning moat. 

### Extended exploration 

The fastest way to explore is by boat. Conveniently, if you go down a coastline, its easy to find your way back by following the coastline the other way. 

As you explore, find, mark by torches, and/or make tall towers. Climbing tall towers or mountains gives you a great view of the surrounding terrain, revealing features that  might otherwise take hours to explore. They also make good "safe houses" if you are caught out at night. 

## Mining

Mining efficiently means MINIMIZING the amount of digging you do and MAXIMIZING the amount of exploring you do. Bring / make plenty of torches and light every space you can as you go to minimize the number of MOBs that spawn there, or at least makes it easier to see them coming. Use the right-hand rule to make it easy to find your way back to the entrance. 

You can find canyons underground as well. Make ladders and use them to go up and down underground canyons. 

There are two things you will never find underground: **food** and **wood**. Therefore bring them down with you while you explore. 

Caves are dangerous. Don't go too deep until you have a full set of armor. 

### Save your stuff often

Build large chests and store useful things you find underground in those chests. You will die often and at unexpected moments, so bring back important resources to your chests frequently. It is almost impossible to recover the things you are carrying when you die (that being said, give it s shot if you can) but anything you put in chests stays in chests. 

### Use water to work for you. 

Water does three important things in caves: 

1. It gives you a fast way to go down cliffs, by jumping into waterfalls
2. It confuses mobs, who fight very badly in water
3. It extinguishes lava which is a very dangerous substance. 

redirect surface water down caves -- but be careful to avoid drowning in underground caves. 

## Building your dream house

At some point you are going to look at your shiny armor, shiny sword, and herds of chickens and cows and think, "Where is my castle?" The answer is, where you build it. Here's some tips for building large structures efficiently. 

1. **Start out in a large and flat territory** there is no greater waste of time then making not-flat terrain flat. If you do find yourself having to hand-flatten terrain, remember its faster to build terrain up by planting dirt than to dig terrain down. 

2. **Build near water**. You will want water for crops and perhaps, for a moat. and its a great place to launch explorations from. 

3. **Rough out your structure with dirt.** Dirt is much faster to build with and stone and you'll find yourself wanting to redo your structure if you mis count or decide you need to build out larger. Digging back stone takes a LOT more time than digging down dirt. 

4. **Build at least one huge tower.** As mentioned before, it makes your home easy to see from a distance, is a safe place for a bederoom, and looks badass. 

5. **Build secondary walls, moats, and entrances.** You don't want to be in the position of being on the wrong side of the only door into your castle -- when there is a creeper at the door. 

6. **Add windows**. You will want to see what lies beyond your gates so you don't step out into an ambush. 

7. **Don't build wheatfields in the shadow of your castle**. Crops need light and crops under the shadow of your structure will take longer to grow. 

8. **Don't waste full blocks on ceilings/floors**. You can build half-blocks of wood and stone for ceilings and floors that are just as good as full blocks and make better use of your resources. They also make good ledges on the inside of your walls. 

## Biomes

### Jungles

Jungles are a bitch to navigate through. But they do have amazingly great trees -- they are 2 x 2. Taking down a fully grown jungle tree can give you as much wood as an entire spruce forest (if you can ignore the implications). Note that the cuttings that drop from jungle trees are MUCH rarer and should be carefully saved and replanted (closer to home).

### Deserts

Deserts are a fine source of sand, which makes for glass and pretty sandstone to build with. Less obviously valuable are the cacti; plant a few around your home and MOBs will bounce around in them and damage themselves trying to get to your. 

### Forests

Forests are kind of a pain; their darkness spawns and protect MOBS and their trees aren't nearly as fertile as jungles. I reccommend burning down any forests nearby and harvesting any surviving wood. 

### Mountains 

Technically, Extreme hills; the best export here is height; climb the tallest mountains, plant torches, and scan the terrain. 

### Swamps

Avoid building near swamps; they damage your ships and are generally unpleasant.

### Plains

Ideal for homesteading on; easy to build buildings, farms, and harvesting seed from. 

## Navigation

The `F3` key will tell you your coordinates. Note the coordinates of your home base and use the HUD coordinates to find your way home. Also, if you find a useful distant resource, note its coordinates to find your way back there again. 

When mining, use the HUD to note how deep you are. The deeper you go the more careful you have to be for lava -- and the more likely you are to find diamonds and iron.

When stepping out to the unknown, leave a torch within the line of sight of other torches. If you end up out at night, it will make it possible to dash home and see any MOBs in your path. 

The best and fastest way to explore is by ship -- its easy to find your way home, your path is relatively unobstructed, and ships are fast than moving by foot. However two waterways are not practically navicable -- rivers and swamps. For some bizarre reason, lilies can destroy your ship. Also, always have at least two spare boats -- nothing's worse than crashing your ship at night on a dark beach without an extra boat to get away on. 

Travelling at a fast clip can often trigger an "Invisible terrain" bug. If you find yourself "at the edge of the world" you are not REALLY at the edge of the world; pump `a + F3` hitting both keys at once, until the terrain redraws. (Once the terrain does start redrawing, don't hit those keys again.) 

### Bring Food, wood and rock

Food is the toughest thing to come by in remote areas; always bring extra. Torches are also tough to come by. The third most difficult thing to find is stone. Bring your own. Lastly, bring wood poles to make extra tools with. 

### Burn it all 

A flint and steel can be made with a single bar of iron and a piece of coal. Burning down large swaths of forests may seem awful but remember these things:

1. The world of Minecraft is infinite.
2. Forests hide and sustain MOBs
3. It is easy to replant forests if you wish to 
4. They aren't real trees. It's only a game. 

Burn it down and create a safe perimiter around you, or use it to help find your way out of strange dense jungle or forests. Also, burnt down terrain creates a very memorable landmark....

### Build roads ... 

By which I mean trenches. Straight trenches one or two units deeep let you dash fast back to your home. Wending around terrain topography burns amazing amount of time and can be disorienting. 

#### .. And lay down rails.

This is more about fun. Never build your own train tracks -- dig deep and steal them from abandoned mines.

### Build towers ...

Tall spikes of dirt/rock with ladders give you a great view of the surrounding terrain and create landmarks you can see for miles around. 

### Build maps ... 

I may be imagining things, but maps are not as useful as they were in earlier editions; they show a very limited amount of area.

### Travel light.

It is very likely that you will die when exploring. Leave your most precious materials at home. Maps, iron pickaxes, diamond gear, magic stuff.. leave it in a chest and go out.

### There is no India

There is a continuous ocean at the edge of your world. If you discover ocean after ocean, head back -- you're not likely to find land after miles of Ocean.
