I've spent most of my life using bicycles to commute. I know a lot of urbanites hem and haw about urban biking, but its a lot easier and safer than you'd think. Here's a few tips I've picked up for getting around safely and efficiently.

## Buying a bike

A bicycle is not a car. It's going to get stolen, damaged or vandalized. So don't spend a month's salary on a bicycle; look at something under $800 in a high visibility color (white or fluorescent). Here's some things to look for in a bike. 
 
* **No pedal clamps or clips**: Besides the fact that they are a pain in the ass and inconvenient in the frequent stops, they can turn an unexpected slick bit on the road from a wobble to an accident. If you find a bike with them you fancy, get them taken off. 
* **No big racks**: if you plan on riding on Bart or CalTrain, they are a real pain when stacking or parking your bike. Stop pretending your bike is a motorcycle and carry what you need on your back. 
* **Straight handlebars**: the classic 70's "Breaking Away" curled handlebars you hunch down over put you in a posture that limits your ability to twist around and check out your surroundings. You'll rarely be on a full tilt run in the city - get used to sitting straight up as much as possible. 
* **Fat, Schrader Tires**: If possible get the tires that you can use a gas station pump to refill. Also, broad off-road type tiers are better in a city than narrow tires. They distribute weight better, so you get fewer flats, and their chunky treads can skip over debris better. Also, they end up in rail grooves much less often. 

### Accessories

Don't piss money away on fancy lights and other gear - it will just get ripped off. Stick to the minimum:

* **u-lock**: a classic kryptonite u-lock is ideal. Make sure its as long as possible, and can fit over a variety of poles. 
* ** Locking Wheel Skewers**: replace quick release wheel hubs with locking skewers; their custom key will obviate any attempt to rip off your tires (and seat, hopefully). This is the only add-on I'd advocate. 
* **Reflective Tape**: A few strips of reflective tape can add visibility to your bike at night -- especially if you have a darker colored frame.

### Safety gear

The most common injury from a bicycle accident is road rash. Pavement is like coarse sandpaper when you hit it at 20 MPH. For that reason, and so you don't look like a tool, skip the lycra bike gear. Denim pants and a light jacket, at minimum, will help you keep skin in a wreck. 

* **gloves**: No matter what when you wreck you will instinctively use your arms and hands to block your fall and protect your head. A good pair of bike gloves will keep some very useful skin on your fingers. 
* **helmet**: Not a bad way to go - I don't helmet up but if you do, don't overthink it. 
* **Cuff Guards**: Your pants can easily get caught in bike chains; wear at least one on the right pants leg. At least, if you don't have those, roll up your right pants leg. 
* **Rear Light**: Put it on your body or a bag, not the bike - so it doesn't get nicked. 

## Riding

The most important thing to remember is you are a vehicle. Stay off the sidewalk; or if you must be on the sidewalk go slowly or walk around other people. 

* **Stay clear of parked cars**: Any parked car can open its door at any moment -- if you are skimming the edge of the road you'll not have time to react. 
* **Don't swerve or lane change needlessly**: Do whatever you can to *drive predictably*. Don't trust drivers to signal when they want to turn or change lanes, and look for eye contact around cars if you need to maneuver through their proximity. 
* **Don't drive so fast that you cannot control your bike.** There are very few circumstances where going full tilt is a good idea. Especially when going down hill, never go so fast that an emergency stop or swerve is hazardous. 
* **Choose roads for safety**. Alleys, side streets and less-used roads are better than main arteries. They have fewer cars. Roads with bus traffic are especially infuriating -- buses constantly stop and block your path. Avoid poorly lit roads and park paths. 
* **Pedestrians are the worst hazards.** They change directions, bolt out, and generally behave like stupid children. keep an extra eye on pedestrians.
* **don't ride on the sidewalk.** Its a dick move; also, unsafe - people will step out from doorways, between cars, also, children and pets on leashes. If you can't take the road, walk your bike. 
* **scan.** Look ahead for merging/turning cars, behind for cars or busses
* **Avoid larger vehicles.** buses and trucks can "trap" you if you try to right along side you. They have multiple blind spots, including immediately in front if they have a large cab. If you can't outpace them, find another route. 


## In the event of an emergency. 

You will inevitably fall or collide. It will not kill you, and probably you'll walk away from the experience. 

* **Do not swerve madly to avoid catastrophe**. half the accidents I've had are about me swerving too hard to avoid hitting something/somebody. If you swerve into traffic to avoid a bump on the road you are making things much worse. 
* **Dismount if possible**. If you can skip off your bike to avoid problems/ stop suddenly, do so. Its the best response to trouble. 
* **clench your fists**. Often the worst damage done in an accident is to your palms as they grind across tarmac. Its natural to try to stabilize your position by "catching yourself" with an open palm. If you can, land on the outside of your forearms -- and not on your elbows as "spiking" an elbow can also make matters worse. 

The worst damage you will take in a typical accident is abrasion. For this reason, long pants and a jacket will really go a long way towards protecting you in a minor collision.
