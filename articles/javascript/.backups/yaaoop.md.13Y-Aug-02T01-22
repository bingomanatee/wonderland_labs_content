I always found "Prototypical" to be a very complex and overly glorified way of describing what Javascript does with the class model. I thought I would give a stab at breaking down the basics of how and why Javascript does instantiation the way it does. 

## Some fundamental but very important concepts

### Objects are Hashes. 

Seems simple enough but getting this is vital to getting anything real done with Javascript. A hash is a set of name-value pairs -- basically a labelled keychain. In a deeper sense it is also a __namespace__ -- that is, for the object variable, each *value* is called *name*. 

``` javascript
var fred = {wife: 'Wilma', kids: 1, male: true, says: ['hey boo boo', 'yabba dabba doo']};
console.log('Freds is male: ', fred.male, ' and his wife is ', fred.wife) // true, wilma

var barney = {wife: Betty', kids: 1, male: true, says: []}
console.log('Barney is male:, barney.male, ' and his wife is ', barney.wife) // true, betty

// lets give Barney a sex change
barney.male = false;
console.log('Barney is male:, barney.male, ' and his very upset wife is ', barney.wife) // false, betty
```

The javascript's engine's task of finding the value of an object by key is pretty readable here. You have set these values in creation, and as shown for poor Barney, you can change them by setting the dot-reference.

## Self-awareness in object code

Since objects can be passed around to different variables, put in arrays, etc., and object variables can be cleared out, the variable names are not permanently assigned to an object. For instance, 

``` javascript

var cup_1 = {has_ball: true};
var cup_2 = {has_ball: false};
var cup_3 = {has_ball: false};

console.log('has ball: cup_1: ', cup_1.has_ball, ',cup 2:', cup_2.has_ball, ',cup 3', cup_3.has_ball); // has ball: cup_1: ', true, ',cup_2:', false, ',cup_3:', false);

var swapper = cup_1;
cup_1 = cup_2;
cup_2 = cup_3;
cup_3 = swapper;

console.log('has ball: cup_1: ', cup_1.has_ball, ',cup 2:', cup_2.has_ball, ',cup 3', cup_3.has_ball); // has ball: cup_1: ', false, ',cup_2:', false, ',cup_3:', true);

```

As shown here, you can switch which variable refers to which object at will. The objects -- which have been re-mapped here -- will retain their assigned values. 

However, if a function has been tacked onto an object, then it will always be able to refer to the host object it is assigned to using the keyword "*this". This simple handy utility is how OOP-like behavior - and a host of nasty side effects -- is accomplished. and THIS is why objects can be considered "Namespaces" of sorts.

Note that "This", when called on an unbound function, or in a root script, refers to the "Global" space, In client side JS, this is the window object. In node, it is the "implied closure" of the module. 

## Some "Power user" tricks

### String key association

You have a larger set of tokens available when naming object keys than is apparent by reading the docs (casually.) 

* You can assign ANY name you can make a string out of a value, by using array syntax:

``` javascript

var barney = {};
barney['favorite outfit'] = 'Ballerina costume';
console.log('barney likes to wear a ', barney['favorite outfit']); // Ballerina costume
```

You can even assign numeric key-value association. The map will be to a string of a number, but with array access, that shouldn't be a problem.

``` javascript

var bedrock_citizens = {};

bedrock_citizen[0] = 'Fred';
bedrock_citizen[1] = 'Barney';
bedrock_citizen[2] = 'Wilma';
bedrock_citizen[3] = 'Betty';

console.log('bedrock citizens: ' bedrock_citizen[0], bedrock_citizen['1'] ... ) // 'Fred', 'Barney'...
```

This does NOT endow an object with the features of an Array but in some circumstances, it might be more useful.
