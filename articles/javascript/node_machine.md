[http://node-machine.org/](http://node-machine.org/) is a great post about a system of decorating functions to make them self-testing, self-documenting and multi-responsive. 

Machines are essentially "meta-functions" that add to the base functionality of a function several badly needed features:

* **Reflection**: the parameters are documented, annotated, and typed
* **Multiple Exit Points**: every possible outcome is documented and given a handling function that all callers must supply for the machine to execute. 
* **Self-testing**: As both the inputs and outputs have an "example" field which is effectively a test condition, the resulting code is a de facto test of itself from jump. 

I.e., everything a javascript function isn't, this is. Its a very exciting example of how you can use JS's native foundation to make some really cool structures.
